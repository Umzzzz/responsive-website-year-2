		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p style="text-indent: 50px">A second year undergraduate student, studying Bsc Web Development at Manchester Metropolitan University. I am currently aspiring to gain a work placement within the area of study I have gained knowledge in. My interests lie in it but also co-operating sectors such as Business or Finance even.</P>

			<p style="text-indent: 50px">The reason why I have chosen this degree is not only due to personal interest and goals, it is to become familiar with technological updates as the world we live in today revolves around media and technology. Industries are looking for fresh talent with new and various ideas to bring to their companies. Becoming successful in the work I do is a must, therefore I am working hard with full motivation to aim high in all of my units so that I get excellent results. Overall I am aiming to get a 1:1</p>

			<p style="text-indent: 50px">In regards to future developments, through job progression I would want a long term career in Web Development. I would like to gain the best experience in a reputable and prestige company within the UK to build on a portfolio. However, through enhancing job prospects, I aspire to own a firm with my brother abroad such as Dubai, to web design for independent and well-known companies. Future aspirations is one of the reasons why I am looking for an internship as to get to what I aspire it is important to make the right path in doing so. To work practically in the work force to gain experience is just as important as having a piece of paper that states 'graduate'. I graduate in June 2016 so it is important for me to gain experience in web development before graduation as it will make job applications an easier step.</p>
